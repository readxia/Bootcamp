## [Question Five]

Write a function that takes an array of words but finds the word "hay"

After your function finds the word it should return a message (as a string) that says:

"found the word at position " plus the index it found the word, so:

If the word occurs more than once return the first occurence.

Example: 
```
findWord(['hay', 'junk', 'hay', 'something', 'nothing'])

should return "found the word at position 0" 
```
