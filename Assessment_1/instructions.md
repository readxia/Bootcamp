# ACC Software Bootcamp - Assesment #1

</center>

## INSTRUCTIONS:

1.  Git clone this `Students_Jan_2023_Reviews` repository to your computer, within your "Bootcamp" folder. 
    - You can run the command `ls -a` to ensure you are not currently in a repository (you would see a `.git` folder). You should not clone a repository within a repository since that will cause issues pushing your work up. Find a more appropriate place to clone if that is the case.

2.  Copy the `01_assessment` folder over to your ACCSoftwareBootcamp repo, so you can edit the contents there and commit/push them for grading.

    For example, get the questions from

    `github.com/ACCSoftwareBootcamp/Students_Jan_2023_Reviews/01_assesment`

    And push your answers to

    `github.com/ACCSoftwareBootcamp/<YOUR_REPO>/01_assesment`


3.  This review is open book. You may use all references available to you to answer the questions. You may ask instructors/mentors to point you in the right direction, if you are stuck. Think of this as a typical work environment, where you may ask a mentor to show you the way, but not do the work for you. Do not ask another student. 

4. You must write your solution directly in `solution.js` file provided for you. We have provided some exmaple data to use for the code. However, we will also test with outlier data to verify your code works for all extremes. 

5.  Please `git add`, `git commit`, `git push` your answers to your private ACCSoftwareBootcamp repository only. Do so as often as you wish, to make sure your answers are backed-up to github.com.

6. 2 parts - Multiple Choice and Practical coding (codewars-style questions).

## TIME AVAILABLE

1. You will have until 11:59pm March 12th, 2023 to push your answers.

2. Many students are able to complete the exam within the 4 hour class. With that said, do try taking breaks. But do not rush yourself if you need to take it slow.

## INTEGRITY:

Remember this review is a test of how well prepared you are. You need an honest answer. Try to satisfy the spirit of the review. While some of the questions may appear difficult, they CAN be answered with some amount of research and thinking. It is more important to learn from this experience, than to bypass it. As such, here are some ground rules

- No sharing of direct or indirect answers, between students.
- Absolutely no sharing of answer code.
- Absolutely no sharing of screens.
- No sharing of url references, your peers can web search too ;-).
- Any clarification from instructors should be posted on Slack under the channel **#assessments** such that all students have access to the same clarification.
