## [Question Two]

In this simple assignment you are given a number and have to make it negative. Take into account a positive or a negative number can be passed into the function. 

Examples
```
returnNegative(1);    // return -1
returnNegative(-10);   // return -10
returnNegative(0);    // return 0
returnNegative(0.33); // return -0.33
```

Notes
The number can be negative already, in which case no change is required.
If the value is zero just return 0
