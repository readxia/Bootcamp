## ACC Software Bootcamp
## FINAL ASSESSMENT


</center>

### INSTRUCTIONS:

1. Git clone this `Students_Jan_2023_Reviews` repository to your computer, within your "Bootcamp" folder. Do not clone it INSIDE an existing git repository.

    - You can run the command `ls -a` to ensure you are not currently in a repository.  If you are in a repo, you would see a `.git` folder in it. You should not clone a repository within a repository since that will cause issues pushing your work up to Github. Find a folder (e.g. Bootcamp or Desktop) and clone it there. 

1. Copy the Final Assessment folder over to your ACCSoftwareBootcamp personal repository, so you may edit the contents there and push them.  

    For example, get the questions from

    `https://github.com/ACCSoftwareBootcamp/Students_Jan_2023_Reviews/Final`

    And push your answers to

    `https://github.com/ACCSoftwareBootcamp/<YOUR_REPO>/Assessment_Final`

    
1. View the questions by using the preview feature built into VSCode, or on github.com, to be able to see the rendered code screenshots.

1. There's a folder for each question type and each question.  Please create a file within the respective folder, as appropriate.  

1. This assessment is in 3 parts

    1. **Multiple choice questions**. These have equal weight and add up to 24% of the evaluation. Please answer all questions.

    2. **Small practice questions**.  These have equal weight and total up to 40% of the evaluation.

    3. **Practical portion**.  This is a small project, that has 36% of the evaluation.

1. This assessment is open book.  You may use all references available to you to answer the questions. You may ask instructors to point you in the right direction, if you are stuck. Think of this as a typical work environment, where you may ask a peer to show you the way, but not do the work for you.

1. If a code snippet on the assessment has a bug, please feel free to fix it and then answer.

1. Please git commit, git push your answers to your private ACCSoftwareBootcamp repository only.

### INTEGRITY: 

Remember this final assessment is a test of how well prepared you are. While some of the questions may appear difficult, they CAN be answered with some amount of research and testing. 

It is important to learn from this experience. As such ...

- Please do not share direct or indirect answers with others.
- No sharing of url references, your peers can web search too ;-).
- Any clarification from instructors should be posted on Slack under the channel **#assessments** such that all students have access to it.
- The instructors may ask you to explain your work over a Zoom meeting, if the submission is not complete or if it appears to be not your work.


### EVALUATION CRITERIA:

1. Evidence of understanding of the underlying concepts related to the question. Can you answer the "why?" where asked? 

1. Does your code have comments? All solutions must have comments explaining what the code does, else it will not be graded. Assume we do not know what you are doing.

1. How complete is your answer and/or your code.  Code is complete if it can handle multiple possible inputs, e.g. user entering input of incompatible data type or no input.

1. Have you indented your code appropriately? 

1. Does your code work, where applicable?

1. Solutions that are directly copied from online sources would not receive any credit. The code must be yours and you must explain how it works in the comments. That is how the examiner would evaluate if you have understood the code, or plainly copied it from someone else.


### TIME AVAILABLE, PASSING CRITERIA & SCORING STRATEGIES

1. This assessment may be completed within 8 hours depending on your ability and speed. However, you may take the day to complete the assessment. Please remember to make your final commit and push by end of the calendar day. Pushes made after the day may be evaluated but with a penalty of 20% on that question.

1. 70% of overall score is needed for PASS status.
1. Some questions are super easy, others are more challenging. To make sure you have enough time for all short questions, pace yourself, return to the difficult ones later. We recommend you attempt all questions, as seemingly difficult questions turn out to be not so difficult.

1. Some questions are designed to not test your knowledge, but your ability to quickly research a topic, understand it and use it or explain it. Hence don't skip questions that seem unfamiliar to you.


1. Credit is given for partially complete or correct answers as well. Hence, please do not skip questions. Take the solution as far as you can.

1. Do attempt the practical solutions and push them, even if they don't work.


Good luck!
